# Language Functionality Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive multi-language support for the Batu Hospital Patient Appointment System with support for **English**, **Amharic (አማርኛ)**, and **Afaan Oromoo**.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **LanguageContext** (`/Client/src/Context/LanguageContext.jsx`)
- Created a React Context for global language state management
- Implements `useLanguage` hook for easy access to translation functions
- Persists language selection in localStorage
- Provides `t()` function for translations throughout the app

### 2. **Updated Language Component** (`/Client/src/Components/Language/Language.jsx`)
- Now functional with actual language switching capability
- Connected to LanguageContext
- Updates all components in real-time when language changes
- Displays current language selection

### 3. **Translation Coverage**

#### Components Updated:
- ✅ **Header** - All navigation items, buttons
- ✅ **HeroSection** - Carousel slides, stats section
- ✅ **Footer** - All sections including links, services, contact info
- ✅ **Login** - Form labels, placeholders, messages
- ✅ **Location** - Page content, contact information, directions
- ✅ **HomePage** - Includes language selector in top bar

#### Translation Keys Added:
- Navigation: home, aboutUs, location, information, ourTeam, ourServices, specialties, appointments, emergency, contact
- Hero Section: welcomeTitle, welcomeSubtitle, welcomeDescription, emergencyTitle, teamTitle
- Stats: emergencyCare, expertDoctors, patientsServed
- Authentication: login, register, username, password, loginTitle, loginSubtitle, welcomeMessage
- Registration: registerTitle, firstName, lastName, email, phoneNumber, confirmPassword, alreadyHaveAccount
- Footer: quickLinks, services, contactUs, aboutSection, copyright, privacyPolicy, termsOfService
- Location: ourLocation, findUs, address, phone, email, workingHours, howToGetHere, byCar, byPublicTransport, byTaxi

### 4. **App Integration** (`/Client/src/main.jsx`)
- Wrapped entire app with `LanguageProvider`
- Ensures language context is available throughout the application

## How It Works

1. **User selects a language** from the dropdown in the Language component
2. **LanguageContext updates** the current language state
3. **Selection is saved** to localStorage for persistence
4. **All components re-render** with new translations using the `t()` function
5. **Language persists** across page refreshes and navigation

## Usage in Components

```jsx
import { useLanguage } from '@/Context/LanguageContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useLanguage();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('welcomeTitle')}</h1>
      <p>{t('welcomeDescription')}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Language Files

All translations are centralized in `/Client/src/Components/Language/languages.js`:
- **English** - Default language
- **Amharic (አማርኛ)** - Full translation coverage
- **Afaan Oromoo** - Full translation coverage

## Features

✅ Real-time language switching
✅ Persistent language selection (localStorage)
✅ Fallback to English if translation missing
✅ Clean, maintainable code structure
✅ Type-safe translation keys
✅ Easy to add new languages
✅ Easy to add new translation keys

## Testing

To test the language functionality:
1. Run the application
2. Click on the language selector (top right)
3. Select different languages (English, አማርኛ, Afaan Oromoo)
4. Navigate between pages to see translations persist
5. Refresh the page - language selection should remain

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Add more languages (Tigrinya, Somali, etc.)
- Add language-specific date/time formatting
- Add RTL support if needed
- Add language-specific number formatting
- Translate dynamic content from backend
